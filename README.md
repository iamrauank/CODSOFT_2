#Landing Page for Codsoft Web Development Internship

As part of my internship at Codsoft, I developed a landing page showcasing my skills in web development. This page features a clean and modern design, utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an engaging user experience. The landing page includes interactive elements such as buttons and dynamic text, and it employs custom fonts and styles to ensure a visually appealing layout. This project allowed me to apply my knowledge of front-end development while adhering to best practices in web design.
